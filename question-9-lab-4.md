## First markdown text section

*This is a markdown text section*

#### Question 8 part 1

1.  Go back to the `.Rmd` file you created in question 7, and include at
    least two Markdown text sections (each should have a header) and at
    least two separate code chunks in it (these can be really simple).
    Save the new R Markdown document and give it a new meaningful name.

## Second markdown text section

*This is another markdown text section*

#### Question 8 part 2

2.  Render/knit the new R Markdown document to get an `.html` file. Put
    the `.Rmd` document and the rendered `.html` file under version
    control using Git, and push/upload the file to your GitHub
    repository for this homework. Paste a link to these files as your
    answer below.
