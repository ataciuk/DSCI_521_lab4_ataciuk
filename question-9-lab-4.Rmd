```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## First markdown text section
_This is a markdown text section_

```{block, type="alert alert-info"}
#### Question 8 part 1

1. Go back to the `.Rmd` file you created in question 7,
   and include at least two Markdown text sections
   (each should have a header)
   and at least two separate code chunks in it (these can be really simple).
   Save the new R Markdown document and give it a new meaningful name.

```

## Second markdown text section
*This is another markdown text section*


```{block, type="alert alert-info"}
#### Question 8 part 2

2. Render/knit the new R Markdown document to get an `.html` file.
   Put the `.Rmd` document
   and the rendered `.html` file under version control using Git,
   and push/upload the file to your GitHub repository for this homework.
   Paste a link to these files as your answer below.
